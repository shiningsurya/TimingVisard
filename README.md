_To be read as Timing Wizard_

Who is a wizard? Not just someone who conjures up a spirit, but someone who can understand the effects of what infinitesimal change in parameters bring forth in residuals. And, by understand, I mean, someone who can visualize the change. _(hence the pun above)_

_The definition of wizard here is very bad. Haha._

As of $7^{th}$ of April 2018, there is one idea under development. 

## ResVisard

It is a GUI application which has residual plot in one side and in other side sliders for each of the parameters that can be fitted. 
You move the slider in any way, the GUI changes the value correspondingly in the `par file`. And, then, you hit `FIT` and **visualize** the structures that come in the residuals.
